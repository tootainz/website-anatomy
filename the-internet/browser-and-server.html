    <h1>Browser and Server</h1>

    <p>aka. Frontend and backend</p>
    <p>Usually a web page is mainly considered as just everything that gets sent to you, but itâ€™s actually a combination of what you receive to the browser (frontend) and what the server does when you send requests to is (backend)</p>

    <h2>Browser</h2>

    <p>A browser is a computer application that runs on your computer.</p>
    <p>A browser is needed to navigate the internet into different addresses</p>
    <p>A browser makes requests to servers</p>
    <p>Servers then send the website code to the browser and the browser shows the actual visual website</p>
    
    <h2>Server</h2>
    
    <p>A server is a computer that runs a specific computer program that is supposed to receive requests and then to do different things based on the requests. Often these things are to send a specific website page but they can also be used to update information on an already sent website or to save information into a store called a database</p>
    <p>Browsers and servers are like inseparable partners. The browser asks the server for a book page that you want to read and the server folds it, sends it like a paper plane over the internet and then the browser unfolds it and shows it to the reader.</p>
    <p>Lets dive deeper and look into what a website is next</p>
