    <h1>Browser and Server</h1>

    <p>Aka. Frontend and backend</p>
    <p>Usually a web page is mainly considered to be just everything that gets sent to you, but itâ€™s actually a combination of what you receive to the browser (frontend) and what the server does when you send requests to is (backend)</p>

    <h2>Browser</h2>

    <p>A browser is a computer application that runs on your computer. It is needed to navigate the web into different addresses</p>
    <p>A browser makes requests to servers which then send the website code to the browser. The browser then reads the code and shows the actual visual website.</p>
    
    <h2>Server</h2>
    
    <p>A server is a computer that runs a specific computer program that is designed to receive requests and then to do different things based on the requests. Often these things are to send a specific website page, but they can also be used to update information on an already sent website or to save information into a store called a database</p>
    <p>Browsers and servers are linseparable partners. Think of it like this: the browser asks the server for a book page that you want to read and the server folds it, sends it like a paper plane over the internet and then the browser unfolds it and shows it to the reader.</p>
    <p>Lets dive deeper and look into what a website is next</p>
