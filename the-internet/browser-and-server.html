        <h1>Browser and Server</h1>

        <p>Aka. frontend and backend</p>
        <p>Usually a web page is mainly considered to be just everything that gets sent to you, but itâ€™s actually a combination of what you receive to the browser (frontend) and what the server does when you send requests to is (backend)</p>
        
        <!-- This is a regular image tag. It links an image to this document from the address given in the src property. -->
        <img src="" alt="Image of browser and client">

        <h2>Browser</h2>

        <p>A browser is a computer application that runs on your computer. It is needed to navigate the web into different addresses</p>
        <p>A browser makes requests to servers which then send the website code to the browser. The browser then reads the code and shows the actual visual website.</p>
        
        <h2>Server</h2>
        
        <p>A server is a computer that runs a specific computer program that is designed to receive requests and then to do different things based on the requests. Often these things are to send a specific website page, but they can also be used to update information on an already sent website or to save information into a store called a database</p>
        <p>Browsers and servers are linseparable partners. Think of it like this: the browser asks the server for a book page that you want to read and the server folds it, sends it like a paper plane over the internet and then the browser unfolds it and shows it to the reader.</p>
        <p>Lets dive deeper and look into what a website is next.</p>

        <!-- And here is another image. The src property contains a text that describes the image. It is used if there is a problem loading the image from the server, or if somebody reads the page with a screenreader. -->
