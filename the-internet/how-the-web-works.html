    <h1>How The Web Works</h1>

    <p>The internet is a collection of computers, that are connected to each other in some way or another.</p>
    <p>Each of these computers has an address called ip address, just like a house has a street address.</p>
    <p>The computers on the internet that can be accessed from other computers are called servers. Not every computer on the internet is a server and can be accessed.</p>
    <p>Computers on the internet can exchange messages and information with each other with the aid of requests that are sent over the connections of the internet.</p>
    <p>These requests are made using the HTTP protocol. basically that just means a common language to send messages to each other so everybody understands.</p>
    <p>The message that we associate most often with the internet is a message containing a website, this is the essence of this book. This book contains basically everything that your computer receives when you make a request to an address in the internet. Before looking further into what a website actually is i want you to know a few terms that you might have heard about before.</p>
