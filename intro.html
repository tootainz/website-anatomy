    <h1>How to navigate this document</h1>

    <p>This is a website, or technically it’s a book, or both, or neither? That’s up for you to decide. However if you are reading this from physical paper, I’ll explain how it works. There is also an online version that you can access.</p>
    <p>Think of this book as a web browser application. It allows you to see the website and look behind the curtains as well</p>
    <p>These right hand pages contain the actual website how you would roughly see it on a computer. However, if you open the page, youll access the “developer tools” that let you look into the code of the website. Open the page and look into the code and we’ll continue forward from there. Or optionally you could read the entire book without opening the “dev tools” but where’s the fun in that?</p>
    <p class="hiddenSecret">The information contained in this book might not be fully accurate and I apologise for any inconsistencies or false information that it might contain. Please accept this more as a piece of art than as a functional application. I would like to remind, that many things have been really simplified on purpose. This is not a comprehensive guide to programming or making web applications but rather a publication that celebrates the technology and aims to raise awareness and increase understanding on how websites work.</p>
