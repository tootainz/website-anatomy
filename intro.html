    Here you see the actual code of the website or how this, the actual HTML document looks like.

    This is a comment. Everything that is between < !-- and -- > is regarded as a comment.
    Comments are not seen on the actual website. They can be used to write information for the developer.

    On these "developer tools" pages, all commentary of the content will therefore be in comments. So if you don't understand anything. look these up and follow them. -->

    <!--  Here we see the same things that we saw on the actual website, but surrounded by a lot of stuff. Dont worry, I'll explain what all of this is a bit later. -->
    <h1>How to navigate this document</h1>

    <p>This is a website, or technically it’s a book, or both, or neither? That’s up for you to decide. However if you are reading this from physical paper, I’ll explain how it works. There is also an online version that you can access.</p>
    <p>Think of this book as a web browser application. It allows you to see the website and look behind the curtains as well</p>
    <p>These pages with white background contain the actual website, how you would roughly see it on a computer. However, if you fold open the page, you’ll access the “developer tools” that let you look into the actual code of the website. Now, fold the page open and look into the code and we’ll continue forward from there. Or, optionally you could read the entire book without opening the “dev tools” but where’s the fun in that?</p>

    <p class="hiddenSecret">The information contained in this book might not be fully accurate and I apologise for any inconsistencies or false information that it might contain. Please accept this more as a piece of art than as a functional application. I would like to remind, that many things have been really simplified on purpose. This is not a comprehensive guide to programming or making web applications but rather a publication that celebrates the technology and aims to raise awareness and increase understanding on how websites work.</p>

    <!-- Alright, let's get into the actual book then. Click the links below or follow them to the desired pages, or just turn the page. Here we go! -->
