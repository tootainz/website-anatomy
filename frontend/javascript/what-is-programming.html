        <h1>What is programming</h1>
        
        <p>Programming in general is instructions for the computer to do something. For example:</p>

        <p><code>Tell me to rest. Wait 10 minutes. Do it again until you have done it 6 times.</code></p>

        <p>This could also be written as something like this:</p>

        <p><code>tell(rest); wait(10); repeat(6);</code></p>

        <p>Computers operate on electric signals that are either on or off. By combining these with logic, they can do complex things. Instructions to a computer must eventually be these on or off messages. These are represented with 1 = on and 0 = off. Instructions in this format are called binary.</p>
        <p>For a human it's practically impossible to understand instructions in binary. That is why we have invented programming languages to help us write those instructions.</p>
        <p>Programming languages are translated on the fly (interpreted) or translated before anything happens (compiled) from a language that's easier for us to understand to a form that a machine can understand: machine code that is in binary.</p>
