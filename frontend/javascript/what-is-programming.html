    <h1>What is programming</h1>
<p>Programming in general is instructions for the computer to do something: tell me to rest, wait 10 minutes and then do it again until you have done it 6 times. If someone presses this button, take their message they have written and send it to me. then clean the message area</p>
<p>computers operate on electric signals that are either on or off. By combining these with logic, they can do complex things.</p>
<p>instructions to a computer must eventually be these on or off messages. so 1 and 0.</p>
<p>A human could never understand them, so that is why we have invented programming languages to help us write the commands.</p>
<p>the languages are translated on the fly (interpreted) or translated before anything happens (compiled) from a language that's easier for us to understand to a form that a machine can understand: machine code that is teh ones and zeroes that represent electric pulses in the computers processor.</p>
