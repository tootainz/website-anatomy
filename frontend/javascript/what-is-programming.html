    <h1>What is programming</h1>
    <p>Programming in general is instructions for the computer to do something. For example:</p>
    <p><code>Tell me to rest. Wait 10 minutes and then do it again until you have done it 6 times.</code></p>
    <p><code>If someone presses the button, take the message that they have written and send it to me. Then clean the message area. Start again from the beginning.</code></p>
    <p>Computers operate on electric signals that are either on or off. By combining these with logic, they can do complex things. Instructions to a computer must eventually be these on or off messages. These are represented with 1 = on and 0 = off.</p>
    <p>For a human it's practically impossible to understand instructions in this format. That is why we have invented programming languages to help us write those instructions.</p>
    <p>Programming languages are translated on the fly (interpreted) or translated before anything happens (compiled) from a language that's easier for us to understand to a form that a machine can understand: machine code that is the ones and zeroes.</p>
