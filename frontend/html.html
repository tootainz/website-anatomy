I assume you have read the page on the website side already. Lets take a deeper dive into what this HTML file actually is.
-->

<!-- As you see here, this is a tag, it tells that this document is a html document then afte rtaht everything is placed inside the html tag. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!-- This is the head tag that we talked about. All of it's content is usually icluded in a typical HTML document-->
<head>
    <!-- This tells what text encoding this document uses -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- This tells how the document should be sized on the screen. The things you see inside the tag like name and content are the tags properties and they are marked with the ="" symbols.-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- Here is the stylesheet link -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../files/styles.css">
    <!-- And finally, the title of the page. This is shown on the browser window, not the actual document itself.-->
    <title>HTML</title>
</head>
<!-- Here is the body tag that contains the actual content of the document that we see. -->
<body>
    <!-- Section is just a way to group tags together. It is similiar to a div tag.
    And another thing: As you see here, inside contents of a tag are usually indented to make the document easier to read for humans making it.-->
    <section>
        <!-- This is a level one header. You can have multiple levels of headers. It tells that this text should be big!! But of course it can be adjusted in CSS how it will look like. -->
        <h1>HTML</h1>

        <!-- These are just plain text paragraphs, These are everywhere adn ar enot very exciting -->
        <p>HTML is a standardised language to help prepare and organise documents (read websites) that the browser can read and display in a consistent manner.</p>
        <p>The language consists of tags that tell the browser how it should interpret that specific part.</p>
        <p>Tags have properties that are usually tied to how the browser interprets them but they can basically be just any information associated with that tag/element.</p>
        <p>In the beginning of the document, there are general things that should be in every HTML document that the browser needs. These are contained inside the head tag. These can be for example links to scripts ot stylesheets, more on those later.</p>
        <p>Everything that will be shown to the user is put inside the body tag.</p>

        <!-- This is a level 2 header -->
        <h2>Examples of tags</h2>

        <!-- This ul tag means an unordered list, so bullet points. There is also an ol, in which the list items would be numbered from 1. forward -->
        <ul>
            <!-- A list must contain list items that are marked with li. These can have other tags inside of them such as in this case a code tag that is used to represent that this text is an example of code. They could also be links such as in the footer down below. -->
            <li>paragraph   <code>&ltp&gt</code></li>
            <li>heading     <code>&lth1&gt</code></li>
            <li>button      <code>&ltbutton&gt</code></li>
            <li>link        <code>&lta&gt</code></li>
            <li>list        <code>&ltul&gt</code></li>
            <li>image       <code>&ltimg&gt</code></li>
        <!-- Most tags have an opening and a closing tag. The closing tag has the / symbol in it. Some tags like line break br or image img can be self closing and just consist of one tag. -->
        </ul>

        <p>Take a peek into the code to see HTML in more detail.<!-- Yay, here we are --></p>
        <p>When the browser receives a HTML document it uses it as instructions to construct an inner model/map of the document called Document Object Model. It then uses that model to display the website visually.</p>
        <p>In our paper plane analogy, HTML document is basically the text content written in the paper.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- This is a footer. It, along with a header are really common in websites. A footer is used to contain info such as links or copyright or other stuff that is usually the same on every page. Footer is in the bottom of a page and headr on the top. A typical header has a logo and navigation links or buttons. -->
    <footer>
        <!-- this nav tag means that the contents inside are used for navigating the website. -->
        <nav>
            <!-- this a tag is a link. It provides a possibility to click it and then the browser navigates to the address given in the href property. -->
            <a href="./website-structure.html">&lt Previous</a>
            <a href="../">Index</a>
            <a href="./css.html">Next page &gt</a>
        </nav>
    </footer>

</body>
</html>
<!-- And here we have reached the end of the document. It's good to know that a browser will always try to display the HTML docuent even if it is not properly written. Therefore text outside of labels is shown on the site. Some labels that are not closed might still work. YOu could also just write the document without these fancy footer, nav, section tags but they are used to make the document easier to understand for the developers and also those who cannot see hte page but use a screenreader. Or search angines will also prefer sites with proper formatting. -->
