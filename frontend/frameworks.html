        <h1>Frameworks</h1>

        <p>We have covered the basics now. Here is a little deep dive into how most of web development looks like at the time of writing this. I wonâ€™t go into much detail here, since it is basically a black hole where there is no return from.</p>
        <p>Many websites use frameworks and external libraries. These are collections of JavaScript code that someone else has written and tested. They contain things that would require a lot of JavaScript that would be similar between different applications. This helps the developer so that they don't need to write and figure out everything by themselves. They can just use the functionality provided by the framework without understanding how it works inside.</p>
        <p>Using frameworks simplifies the way you write code, but can be hard to set up and you have to learn new ways to do things.</p>
        <p>The idea with most frontend frameworks is that they follow what happens on the website and automatically update the associated values or system state. Instead of manually having to tell that every time this button is pushed you need to update the 2nd, 3rd , 4rth etc, values individually, a framework does it automatically.</p>
        <p>For example, some frameworks/libraries for frontend development are React, Vue, Angular, Svelte.</p>
