    <h1>Frameworks</h1>

    <p>We have covered the basics now. Here is a little deep dive into how most of web development looks like at the time of writing this.</p>
    <p>I won’t go into much detail here, since it is basically a black hole where there is no return from, but</p>
    <p>Many websites use frameworks and external libraries.</p>
    <p>These basically mean javascript code that someone else has written</p>
    <p>Frameworks are ways to write websites in a way that helps with things that would require a lot javascript taht is quite similar between different applications.</p>
    <p>Collections of tested code that does the same thing so you don't need to write and figure out everything by yourself</p>
    <p>It simplifies the way you write code, but can be hard to set up and you have to learn new ways to do things.</p>
    <p>The idea with most frontend frameworks is that they follow what happens on the website and automatically update the associated values. Instead of manually having to tell that every time this button is pushed you need to update the 2nd, 3rd , 4rth etc, values individually, but it does it automatically.</p>
    <p>For example some frameworks/libraries for frontend development are React, Vue, Angular, Svelte.</p>
    <p>This page is an example of a page that is made with Svelte, you can look into the code to see how it differs from “vanilla”, but I won't explain it further here.</p>
